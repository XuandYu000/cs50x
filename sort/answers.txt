sort1 uses: Bubble sort.
How do you know?: I run the sorts on the three text files which contain 50000 numbers.
The result is following:
      random  sorted  reversed
sort1 8.487   2.311   6.545
sort2 1.495   2.118   2.114
sort3 4.603   4.126   4.872
The difference between the best result and the worst is too large.
The best result is n order of magnitude and the worst result is on the order of n squared.
sort2 uses: Merge sort.
How do you know?: I run the sorts on the three text files which contain 50000 numbers.
The result is following:
      random  sorted  reversed
sort1 8.487   2.311   6.545
sort2 1.495   2.118   2.114
sort3 4.603   4.126   4.872
The difference between the best result and the worst is small.
The best result and worst are both n order of magnitude.
